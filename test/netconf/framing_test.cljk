  "RFC 6242 §4.2 chunked framing. The single most important test file in
  this repo (see README): chunking is defined to be split-boundary
  agnostic, and the boundary-sweep tests below are what actually prove
  this decoder honors that, rather than just proving encode/decode agree
  with themselves.

  ASCII bytes are written as hex literals (0x23 for '#', etc.) or built
  via `netconf.bytes/utf8-encode`, deliberately never via `(int \\c)` or
  `(map int \"str\")` — on ClojureScript a character literal like `\\#`
  and a string element from `(seq \"str\")` are both one-character
  STRINGS, and `int` of one does not give its code point (it silently
  coerces through `ToInt32` on the string via NaN, i.e. 0). This
  workspace's own org-modbus/org-ietf-websocket/org-ietf-argon2 READMEs
  each record hitting exactly this idiom in one day; `netconf.bytes`
  exists specifically so this file doesn't repeat it a fourth time."
